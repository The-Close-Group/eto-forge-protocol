23:["$","p",null,{"children":"When market prices drift beyond the DMM's operating range, the Peg Stability Module activates as a second line of defense. The PSM holds reserves of both the index token and stablecoins, allowing it to trade against the market to apply corrective pressure. Unlike the DMM which provides passive liquidity, the PSM actively intervenes when deviation exceeds defined thresholds."}]
24:["$","p",null,{"children":"The PSM's activation threshold is typically set at the outer edge of the DMM's band. If the on-chain market price trades at a premium to the oracle reference price beyond this threshold, the PSM can sell index tokens from its reserves to push the price down. If the market trades at a discount, the PSM can buy tokens to push the price up. These interventions are rate-limited and subject to utilization caps to prevent reserve depletion during sustained one-directional pressure."}]
25:["$","p",null,{"children":"The PSM captures spread during these operations. When it intervenes, it trades at the oracle reference price plus or minus a small fee. This fee structure means the PSM tends to generate revenue during periods of elevated volatility, which helps maintain its reserve buffers over time. The captured spread does not go to any individual but rather accrues to the protocol's net asset value, benefiting all token holders proportionally."}]
26:["$","p",null,{"children":"The PSM operates with explicit constraints on how much capital it can deploy per transaction, per hour, and per day. These constraints prevent the PSM from exhausting its reserves during extreme scenarios and ensure that its interventions remain economically rational. If market pressure persists beyond what the PSM can handle within its constraints, the system escalates to the third layer of protection."}]

2a:["$","p",null,{"children":"The stability mechanisms described above all depend on accurate reference pricing.

2b:["$","p",null,{"children":"Oracle validation includes staleness detection, which rejects data older than a defined threshold, and deviation bounds that flag any individual feed reporting prices far from the consensus median.

This conservative approach to data quality prevents the protocol from making decisions based on potentially manipulated or failed oracle feeds."}]

30:["$","p",null,{"children":"Circuit breakers represent the final safeguard layer, activating under conditions that exceed both the DMM's normal operating range and the PSM's intervention capacity. These mechanisms monitor sustained deviations between on-chain prices and oracle references, oracle data staleness, and rapid liquidity changes. When predefined thresholds are exceeded, circuit breakers automatically throttle or halt specific protocol operations."}]
31:["$","p",null,{"children":"The circuit breaker system operates in three tiers. Warning mode activates when deviation exceeds one percent for a sustained period, increasing monitoring intensity and sending alerts but making no operational changes. Throttle mode engages at two percent sustained deviation, reducing the magnitude of price updates and slowing recentering operations to prevent rapid system adjustments during uncertain conditions. Halt mode triggers at five percent sustained deviation or under severe oracle failures, temporarily pausing price updates and stabilization mechanisms entirely."}]
32:["$","p",null,{"children":"During a halt, users can still exit positions but the protocol will not process new price updates or rebalancing operations until the triggering condition resolves. This prevents the protocol from making decisions based on potentially corrupted data. If a halt persists and the issue cannot be resolved through normal recovery procedures, the protocol includes emergency procedures to return user funds in stablecoins rather than leaving capital locked indefinitely."}]

Activation thresholds differ from deactivation thresholds, ensuring the system does not rapidly toggle between warning and normal operation or between throttle and warning.
