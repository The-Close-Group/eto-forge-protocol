This design eliminates the need for ongoing rebalancing operations, which would introduce additional intermediaries and trust assumptions.\\n\\nMAANG does not confer ownership of the underlying shares, does not distribute dividends, and provides no shareholder rights. It is purely a price exposure instrument.\\n\\n## How to Access MAANG\\n\\nMAANG runs on an Avalanche-powered L1 subnet designed specifically for ETO's index products. Users acquire MAANG through ETO's swap interface using USDC from multiple networks. The interface includes automatic routing to the ETO subnet, eliminating manual bridging.\\n\\nContract addresses should always be verified through the official ETO application interface, not documentation.

Oracle failures, delays, or manipulation could affect pricing accuracy.\\n\\n  **Stablecoin risk**: The system uses USDC for settlements. Issues with USDC itself would affect the ability to enter or exit positions.\\n\\n  **Administrative risk**: The protocol includes administrative controls for upgrades and emergency interventions. These controls could be misused or compromised.\\n\\n  **Regulatory risk**: The regulatory status of tokenized equity exposure varies by jurisdiction and may change over time. Users are responsible for understanding their local regulations.\\n\\n  **No investment advice**: Nothing in this documentation constitutes investment advice.

The protocol enables users to diversify beyond crypto markets while maintaining full control of their assets and accessing the composability of DeFi.\\n\\nTraditional market access requires intermediaries, multi-day settlement, geographic restrictions, and custody relationships. ETO eliminates these barriers by bringing real-world market exposure directly on-chain, where it can be held in any wallet, traded against stablecoins, and integrated into DeFi protocols without relying on custody-backed redemption programs.\\n\\n## DeFi-Native by Design\\n\\nETO's infrastructure is built on core DeFi principles that differentiate it from centralized or custody-based alternatives:\\n\\n**Self-custody**: Users hold assets directly in their own wallets with no intermediary control.\\n\\n**Permissionless access**: Interaction is wallet-based, not account-based. No gatekeepers, no application process.\\n\\n**Composability**: Assets behave like standard ERC-20 tokens and integrate seamlessly across protocols.\\n\\n**Transparency**: System behavior is defined by on-chain contracts and verifiable data inputs.\\n\\n**Instant settlement**: Trades and transfers finalize on-chain immediately, not in days.\\n\\nThese properties shape both what users hold (the tokens) and how the system maintains pricing and liquidity.\\n\\n## The Products\\n\\n### On-Chain Index Tokens\\n\\nETO's core products are index tokens that track real-world reference prices using oracle-based mechanisms. Users can acquire, hold, transfer, and exit these tokens with stablecoins in a way that resembles typical DeFi usage: simple custody, programmatic integrations, and on-chain settlement.\\n\\n### Infrastructure Layer\\n\\nBeyond the tokens themselves, ETO provides the underlying infrastructure for pricing, liquidity, and risk management. This infrastructure supports both ETO's own index products and potential integration partners who want to build on the same foundation.\\n\\n## How Pricing and Liquidity Work\\n\\nETO maintains reliable pricing and usable liquidity through three integrated systems. The technical details are covered in the [Architecture](/docs/architecture/overview) section, but here's what matters for users:\\n\\n**Dynamic pricing**: Token prices continuously reflect real-world reference prices through oracle feeds, with built-in smoothing and bounds checking.\\n\\n**Concentrated liquidity**: A Dynamic Market Maker (DMM) keeps most liquidity in a tight band around the current reference price, delivering low spreads and high execution quality.\\n\\n**Peg stability**: When market prices drift beyond normal ranges, a Peg Stability Module (PSM) applies backstop pressure using protocol reserves to help the market re-align.\\n\\n**Safety controls**: Circuit breakers and rate limits throttle or pause specific actions under defined stress conditions, making failure modes explicit and system behavior predictable.\\n\\nThese mechanisms work together to keep on-chain prices closely aligned with external reference values while maintaining usable liquidity and explicit safety controls. See [Architecture → Overview](/docs/architecture/overview) for the complete technical design.\\n\\n## MAANG: 5 Tech Giants, 1 Token\\n\\nETO's first flagship product is **MAANG**, an index token representing exposure to five large-cap technology companies:\\n\\n* Meta\\n* Amazon\\n* Apple\\n* Nvidia\\n* Google (Alphabet)\\n\\nMAANG is designed to provide price exposure to this basket through the protocol's oracle-based tracking system. It does not confer shareholder rights, dividends, or a claim on custody-held shares.

No security model eliminates all risk, but this architecture is designed to make the most common failure modes explicit, bounded, and recoverable.\\n\\n## Independent Security Audits\\n\\nETO maintains a continuous audit engagement with Octane Security, a smart contract security firm specializing in DeFi protocols. Unlike point-in-time audits that examine code at a single moment, this arrangement provides ongoing review as the protocol evolves. Octane Security's work includes code review for all contract deployments, monitoring of deployed contracts for anomalous behavior, security advisory support for architectural decisions, and incident response capabilities if issues are discovered.\\n\\nThis continuous relationship means security review happens throughout the development lifecycle rather than only before launch. As new features are developed or existing contracts are upgraded, they undergo the same rigorous examination that applied to the initial implementation. The ongoing nature of this engagement also means that emerging threats or newly discovered vulnerability patterns can be assessed against ETO's deployed contracts even if those threats were unknown at the time of initial deployment.\\n\\nAll audit reports are published once remediation is complete. Current and historical audit reports are available in the Audits section of this documentation. Each report includes scope definition, findings categorized by severity, remediation status, and any acknowledged residual risks. This transparency allows users and integrators to make informed decisions based on the same security assessment available to the development team.\\n\\n## Protocol-Level Safeguards\\n\\nSecurity mechanisms are encoded directly into the protocol's smart contracts, creating automated protection that operates independently of any individual's actions. These safeguards define the boundaries within which the protocol can operate and specify what happens when those boundaries are approached or exceeded.\\n\\nCircuit breakers monitor deviation between on-chain token prices and oracle-provided reference prices. When deviation exceeds defined thresholds for a sustained period, the system automatically pauses price updates and stabilization mechanisms. This prevents the protocol from executing trades or adjustments based on potentially compromised data. Users can still exit positions during circuit breaker activation, but the protocol will not process new pricing updates until the issue is resolved. The specific thresholds and persistence windows are calibrated to distinguish between normal market volatility and genuine system stress.\\n\\nOracle validation aggregates price data from multiple independent sources and applies bounds checking before accepting any feed. If a price source reports values that deviate significantly from the median of other sources, that feed is excluded from calculations. If sufficient feeds are unavailable or stale beyond acceptable thresholds, the system treats this as a circuit breaker condition rather than proceeding with incomplete data. This multi-source approach combined with active validation reduces the risk that any single oracle failure or manipulation attempt can corrupt the protocol's price reference.\\n\\nRate limiting constrains how quickly capital can flow in or out of protocol-controlled pools. These limits prevent rapid drainage scenarios where an attacker or bug could extract the majority of liquidity in a short timeframe. The limits are calibrated to allow normal trading activity while making economically significant exploits visible and interruptible. If an unusual pattern emerges that suggests coordinated extraction or a malfunctioning contract, the rate limits buy time for monitoring systems to detect the issue and for the guardian role to intervene if necessary.\\n\\nAdministrative timelocks enforce waiting periods on protocol upgrades and parameter changes. Critical modifications cannot be executed immediately upon proposal. Instead, they must be publicly announced and wait through a defined timelock period before activation. This gives users visibility into pending changes and time to exit if they disagree with proposed modifications. The timelock mechanism makes governance actions transparent and predictable rather than allowing opaque or sudden changes to protocol behavior.\\n\\nFor complete technical specifications of these mechanisms, see [Architecture → Safety Controls](/docs/architecture/safety-controls).\\n\\n## Ongoing Monitoring and Response\\n\\nSecurity is not a one-time achievement but an ongoing operational discipline. ETO maintains monitoring infrastructure that tracks protocol health metrics, oracle feed reliability, liquidity pool composition, and contract interaction patterns. This monitoring operates continuously and generates alerts when observed behavior deviates from expected patterns.\\n\\nWhen monitoring detects anomalies, automated alerts notify the security response team. For high-severity issues, the protocol's guardian role can pause affected modules immediately while the issue is investigated. This guardian capability is deliberately limited in scope. It can halt operations to prevent further damage but cannot move user funds or modify core protocol logic. The separation between emergency pause authority and fund control authority reduces the risk that any single compromised key or malicious actor could both halt the protocol and extract capital.\\n\\nIncident response procedures define clear escalation paths, communication protocols, and remediation workflows. If a vulnerability is discovered, the priority hierarchy is user fund safety first, protocol stability second, and feature availability third. Users will receive clear communication about any security incidents, their impact, and remediation steps through official channels. The protocol will not resume normal operations until the issue is understood, remediated, and verified.\\n\\n<Callout type=\\\"info\\\">\\n  ## Responsible Disclosure\\n\\n  If you discover a security vulnerability in ETO's contracts or infrastructure, please report it responsibly by emailing [security@eto.finance](mailto:security@eto.finance). Do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before giving the team reasonable time to assess and remediate. Reports submitted through this channel will receive timely acknowledgment and investigation.\\n</Callout>\\n\\n***\\n\\n**Next:**\\n\\n* [Trust and Security → Audits](/docs/security/audits) for published audit reports\\n* [Architecture → Safety Controls](/docs/architecture/safety-controls) for technical implementation details\\n* [Risk Disclosure](/docs/risk-disclosure) for comprehensive risk information\\n\";\nexport let frontmatter = {\n  \"title\": \"Trust and Security\",\n  \"description\": \"ETO's security model combines independent audits, protocol-level safeguards, and continuous monitoring to protect user funds.\"\n};\nexport let structuredData = {\n  \"contents\": [{\n    \"heading\": \"trust-and-security\",\n    \"content\": \"ETO's security approach operates across three layers: independent verification through continuous auditing, protocol-level safety mechanisms encoded in smart contracts, and operational monitoring that detects and responds to emerging threats.

When Bitcoin falls, most liquid tokens fall with it. When risk appetite returns, it often returns across the board. For investors trying to manage drawdowns, this correlation creates a structural constraint: there is limited diversification *within* the asset class.\\n\\nPublic equities offer a partial counterweight. Large U.S. technology stocks, for example, have often exhibited lower correlation to crypto than crypto assets show to each other. Exposure to companies like Apple or Nvidia alongside ETH can reduce portfolio volatility without requiring an investor to fully exit on-chain markets.\\n\\nThe target state is clear: preserve self-custody and composability, but add exposure to assets that do not move in lockstep with crypto. This objective drove the first wave of attempts to bring equity exposure on-chain.\\n\\n## Early Approaches to On-Chain Equity Exposure\\n\\nTwo broad architectures emerged: synthetic assets and custody-backed tokens. Both can provide price exposure, but each introduces tradeoffs that become more visible under stress.\\n\\n### Synthetic Assets\\n\\nEarly systems used synthetic tokens that tracked stock prices without holding the underlying shares. Protocols such as Mirror Protocol (Terra) and Synthetix allowed users to mint or trade synthetic exposure using overcollateralized positions and oracle price feeds.\\n\\nThis approach avoided traditional intermediaries. There was no brokerage account holding shares, typically no KYC gate at the protocol level, and access was globally permissionless. Synthetic exposure could also trade continuously, independent of equity market hours.\\n\\nThe limiting factor is that the peg depends on incentives and mechanism performance. Synthetic systems rely on liquidations and arbitrage to keep prices aligned with oracle references. Under extreme volatility or impaired liquidity, these mechanisms can lag, become expensive, or fail to clear. If the collateral underpinning the system becomes unstable, the synthetic market can unwind quickly. In May 2022, the Terra ecosystem collapse caused severe dislocations across dependent protocols, and Mirror’s synthetic assets did not regain durable, reliable pegs.\\n\\nEven in normal regimes, synthetics tend to carry ongoing frictions: oracle latency can create extractable arbitrage, and overcollateralization reduces capital efficiency relative to the exposure created.\\n\\n### Custody-Backed Tokens\\n\\nA second class of products issued tokens backed one-to-one by shares held with a custodian. In this model, when a user purchases tokenized equity, corresponding shares are held in off-chain accounts intended to support redemption.\\n\\nThis architecture simplifies price tracking: redeemability anchors the token’s value to the underlying asset. The peg is not primarily maintained by an on-chain algorithm, but by a legal and operational claim on custody-held shares.\\n\\nThe tradeoff is that the custody model reintroduces intermediaries. Users must trust the custodian and associated operators to remain solvent and to honor redemptions. Access commonly requires KYC and jurisdictional filtering. Settlement depends on traditional financial rails, so minting and redemption can take hours or days rather than seconds. In many implementations, tokens are also less composable with permissionless DeFi due to transfer restrictions or issuer controls.\\n\\nCustody-backed designs can deliver exposure with strong tracking, but they often weaken the properties that make on-chain assets useful: self-custody, programmability, and permissionless integration.\\n\\n## Why ETO Exists\\n\\nTaken together, these histories point to a consistent set of constraints that a “native” on-chain approach needs to satisfy simultaneously, rather than trading one property off against another.\\n\\nA viable design must maintain tight price reflection under stress, preserve self-custody in a standard token form, and keep settlement on-chain and immediate. It must also support sustainable liquidity—capital-efficient enough to be usable without permanent subsidies—while embedding explicit safety controls for oracle failure modes and market dislocations.\\n\\nETO represents an iteration in this direction: a non-custodial model for equity-basket price exposure that is designed to reduce dependence on off-chain share custody, issuer-mediated redemption, and the operational gating that typically follows from those dependencies (such as KYC workflows, jurisdictional access controls, and slower settlement).
