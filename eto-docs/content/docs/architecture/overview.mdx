# Architecture Overview

ETO's architecture is designed to solve a specific problem: maintaining reliable on-chain prices that closely track real-world asset values while providing usable liquidity and explicit safety boundaries. The system achieves this through three integrated layers that respond to different market conditions, oracle-based pricing that aggregates multiple data sources, and token economics that keep supply and value transparent and verifiable.

The architecture prioritizes predictability over complexity. Each mechanism has defined operating conditions, clear triggers for activation, and known limits on its authority. This makes system behavior understandable and allows users to reason about what will happen under various market scenarios.

## The Core Challenge

Traditional financial markets maintain price alignment through centralized intermediaries, custody relationships, and multi-day settlement processes. Bringing real-world asset exposure on-chain eliminates these intermediaries but creates a new challenge: how to keep the on-chain token price synchronized with external reference prices when those prices change continuously and the on-chain system has no direct authority over the underlying assets.

ETO addresses this through a combination of oracle-based reference pricing, concentrated liquidity that makes arbitrage efficient, and reserve-backed stabilization that can absorb larger dislocations. The goal is not perfect alignment at every moment but rather tight tracking over relevant time horizons with explicit bounds on maximum deviation.

## Three-Layer Stability System

ETO employs a three-layer defense system where each layer handles progressively more severe price deviations. This layered approach concentrates capital and operational complexity where it delivers the most value while keeping the system efficient during normal conditions.
