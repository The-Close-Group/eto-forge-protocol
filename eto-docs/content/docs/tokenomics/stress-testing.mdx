## Performance Benchmarking

### Tracking Accuracy Measurement

#### Baseline Comparison

| Product | Historical Tracking Error |
|---------|--------------------------|
| SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) | ~0.03% annually |
| iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) | ~0.05% annually |
| **DRI Target** | less than 0.1% daily average absolute deviation |

#### Measurement Framework

$$
\text{Tracking Error} = \frac{\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[(P_{\text{DRI}} - P_{\text{Index}})^2]}}{P_{\text{Index}}}
$$

$$
\text{Daily Deviation} = \frac{|P_{\text{DRI}}^{\text{close}} - P_{\text{Index}}^{\text{close}}|}{P_{\text{Index}}^{\text{close}}}
$$

$$
T_{\text{recovery}} = \inf\{t : |\varepsilon_t| < 0.5\%\} - t_{\text{shock}}
$$

### Capital Efficiency Validation

#### Traditional ETF Capital Requirements

| Method | Capital Requirement |
|--------|-------------------|
| Full Replication | 100% of index value in underlying assets |
| Sampling Method | 90-95% of index value plus cash buffer |
| **DRI Target** | ~50% of index value through concentrated liquidity |

#### Efficiency Metrics

$$
CE = \frac{L_{\text{provided}}}{K_{\text{deployed}}}
$$

$$
U = \frac{V_{\text{active}}}{L_{\text{available}}}
$$

$$
\text{Slippage}(s) = \frac{\Delta P(s)}{s} \quad \text{(price impact per unit size)}
$$
