# Economic Model

The DRI Protocol implements a dual-token system designed to separate governance rights from economic exposure.

---

## Token Architecture

### DRI Token

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 50,000,000 DRI (fixed, non-inflationary) |
| **Purpose** | Index tracking token representing protocol economic value |
| **Transferable** | Fully tradeable on secondary markets |
| **Functionality** | Core protocol token for all economic operations |

### GOV-DRI Token

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Total Supply** | 1,000,000 GOV-DRI (fixed, non-inflationary) |
| **Purpose** | Governance rights and protocol decision-making |
| **Transferable** | Non-transferable (exception: multisig key rotation) |
| **Functionality** | Voting power in governance proposals |

---

## Initial Distribution and Allocation

### Genesis Allocation

At protocol launch, the 50M DRI supply is allocated as follows:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              DRI TOKEN GENESIS ALLOCATION                │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│  Dynamic Market Maker (40%) — 20,000,000 DRI             │
│  • Provides immediate liquidity for trading              │
│  • Concentrated in ±0.25% bands (200× capital efficiency)│
│  • Generates 0.30% trading fees for sustainability       │
│                                                          │
│  Peg Stability Module (50%) — 25,000,000 DRI             │
│  • Reserve backing for arbitrage interventions           │
│  • Paired with equivalent USDC token reserves            │
│  • 0.50% intervention fee, 1% swap cap per tick          │
│                                                          │
│  Expansion Buffer (10%) — 5,000,000 DRI                  │
│  • Held in TrancheVault for future expansion             │
│  • Released through milestone-based auctions             │
│  • Ensures controlled supply growth                      │
│                                                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

<Callout type="info">
**Fixed Supply:** DRI has a fixed 50M supply with no minting capability. The PSM explicitly enforces `CRITICAL FIX: DRI has fixed supply - no minting allowed`.
</Callout>

### GOV-DRI Distribution

Governance tokens are distributed to ensure decentralized control:

| Allocation | Percentage | Details |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Founding Team** | 20% | 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff, ensures long-term alignment |
| **Community Governance** | 60% | Distributed through participation incentives, includes early adopters |
| **Protocol Treasury** | 15% | Reserved for future initiatives, controlled by governance vote |
| **Strategic Reserve** | 5% | Emergency governance backup, requires 90% community vote to activate |

---

## Supply Expansion Mechanism

### Milestone-Based Tranches

The DRI Protocol implements controlled supply expansion through market cap milestones:

| Tranche | Market Cap Trigger | DRI Unlock |
|---------|-------------------|------------|
| **T-1** | $350M | 1,000,000 DRI |
| **T-3** | $750M | 1,500,000 DRI |
| **T-5** | $1B | Remaining buffer |

### Expansion Auction Mechanism

When milestones are reached, new tokens are distributed through sealed-bid auctions:

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Auction Announcement | 7 days | Notice period with full auction details |
| Bidding Period | 24 hours | Sealed bid submission window |
| Price Discovery | — | Dutch auction with oracle-anchored floor price |
| Allocation | — | Pro-rata distribution based on bid prices |
| Settlement | — | Automatic token delivery and USDC collection |

### Minimum Bid Price Formula

The auction mechanism prevents discount dilution:

$$
P_{\text{bid}}^{\min} = \max\left(
  P_{\text{oracle}} \times 0.95,\;
  P_{\text{TWAP}}^{30d} \times 0.90,\;
  P_{\text{prev\_auction}} \times 0.98
\right)
$$

## Fee Structure and Revenue Model

### Revenue Sources

#### Trading Fees (0.30%)

| Aspect | Details | Contract Parameter |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Applied to | All DMM swaps | `feePips: 3000` |
| Split | 70% protocol treasury, 30% governance rewards | Via `collectFees()` |
| Est. Annual Revenue | $2–5M (based on projected volume) | — |

<Callout type="info">
**Fee Distribution:** DMM fees are collected via `collectFees(recipient)` and should be distributed: 70% to protocol treasury, 30% to governance reward pool.
</Callout>

#### PSM Intervention Fees (0.50%)

| Aspect | Details | Contract Parameter |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Applied to | Arbitrage peg maintenance operations | `feeRate: 0.005e18` |
| Swap Cap | 1% of pool TVL per tick | `swapCap: 0.01e18` |
| Max USDC Draw | 20% of reserve per operation | `maxUsdcDraw: 0.2e18` |
| Purpose | Discourages excessive PSM usage, generates revenue | — |
| Est. Annual Revenue | $200K–500K | — |

<Callout type="warn">
**Peg Stability Optimization:** The 0.50% PSM fee (vs 0.30% DMM) creates a fee gradient that encourages normal trading through DMM while reserving PSM for genuine peg defense. The 1% swap cap allows aggressive peg restoration when needed.
</Callout>

#### Expansion Auction Premiums

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Source | Market-driven premiums above oracle floor |
| Allocation | 100% to protocol treasury |
| Est. Revenue per Tranche | $50K–200K |

---

## PSM Fee Structure

The PSM applies variable fees based on utilization and market conditions:

### Base Fee Calculation

$$
f_{\text{base}} = f_0 \times \left(1 + \kappa \cdot U_t\right)
$$

Where $f_0$ is the base fee rate (e.g., 0.50%) and $\kappa$ is the utilization multiplier.

### Volatility Adjustment

During high volatility periods, fees increase:

$$
f_{\text{vol}} = f_{\text{base}} \times \left(1 + \gamma \cdot \sigma_{\text{realized}}\right)
$$

### Final Fee Calculation

$$
f_{\text{total}} = \min(f_{\text{vol}}, f_{\max}) \times S_{\text{notional}}
$$



---

## Protocol Sustainability

Revenue allocation ensures long-term protocol sustainability:

| Category | Allocation | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **Operational Expenses** | 40% | Oracle fees, keeper incentives, infrastructure |
| **Security Budget** | 30% | Audits, bug bounties, insurance reserves |
| **Development Fund** | 20% | Protocol improvements and new features |
| **Governance Rewards** | 10% | Incentives for active governance participation |

---

## Reserve-Adjusted PSM Threshold

The PSM threshold adapts based on reserve levels:

$$
\theta_{\text{adaptive}} = \theta_{\text{base}} \times \left(1 - 0.5 \cdot U_{\text{reserve}}\right)
$$

<Callout type="info">
This makes PSM **more conservative as reserves are depleted**, protecting the system from over-extension.
</Callout>

## Operational Constraints and Gas Economics

### Gas Cost Analysis (Avalanche C-Chain)

```solidity
// syncPrice() function breakdown:
Oracle calls (3 sources):           ~15,000 gas each = 45,000 gas
Price calculations:                 ~8,000 gas  
Storage updates:                    ~5,000 gas
Event emissions:                    ~2,000 gas
DMM recentering (when triggered):   ~65,000 gas
PSM check:                          ~3,000 gas
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total (normal operation):           ~63,000 gas
Total (with recentering):           ~128,000 gas
```

### Cost Analysis at Different Gas Prices

| Gas Price | Normal Sync | With Recentering |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| 25 gwei (calm) | $0.80 | $1.60 |
| 50 gwei (busy) | $1.60 | $3.20 |
| 100 gwei (congested) | $3.20 | $6.40 |

### Daily Operational Costs (30-second intervals)

| Gas Price | Daily Cost (2,880 syncs) |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 25 gwei | $2,304/day |
| 50 gwei | $4,608/day |
| 100 gwei | $9,216/day |

### Adaptive Sync Intervals

To manage costs while maintaining responsiveness:

$$
T_{\text{sync}} = T_{\text{base}} \times \xi
$$

Where:

$$
\xi = \max\left(0.5,\; \min\left(4.0,\; \frac{1}{\sigma_{\text{rolling}}}\right)\right)
$$

| Market Condition | Interval | Gas Savings |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Calm (σ less than 0.5%) | 2-minute | ~75% |
| Normal (0.5% ≤ σ ≤ 2%) | 30-second | Baseline |
| Volatile (σ greater than 2%) | 15-second | 2× cost |

### Gas Budget Management

$$
B_{\text{gas}}^{\text{daily}} = \min\left(
  0.3 \times F_{\text{trading}},\;
  0.0001 \times TVL
\right)
$$

<Callout>
Maximum 30% of fees for operations, or 0.01% of TVL daily.
</Callout>
